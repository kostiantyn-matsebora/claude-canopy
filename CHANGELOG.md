Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added

- Markdown list syntax (`*` nested lists) as an alternative to box-drawing characters for tree definitions — write trees directly under `## Tree` without a fenced code block
- `examples/` documentation split out to `claude-canopy-examples` repo; canopy repo stays submodule-clean

### Changed

- `rules/skill-resources.md` — Tree format section now documents both syntaxes with examples
- `FRAMEWORK.md` — Tree Execution Model section shows both formats side-by-side; Skill-Local ops.md section shows markdown list format as alternative for branching op definitions
- `README.md` — `## Tree` anatomy and minimal example updated to lead with markdown list syntax
- `skills/canopy-skill/policies/optimization-rules.md` — Rule 6 updated to list both formats; markdown list marked as preferred for new/simple trees

## [0.3.2] — 2026-04-12

### Added

- community health files for GitHub: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, issue templates, and pull request template

---

## [0.3.1] — 2026-04-12

### Changed

- `README.md` — replaced the broken external examples link with plain repo mention, made the `## Agent` example generic instead of project-specific, and reduced duplication between `Skill Anatomy` and `Writing a Skill`

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- `setup.ps1` — create directory junctions in `.claude/skills/` for each bundled canopy skill so VS Code discovers them outside the submodule boundary
- `setup.sh` — create symlinks in `.claude/skills/` for each bundled canopy skill for the same reason on Linux/macOS

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added

- `setup.sh` and `setup.ps1` — submodule setup scripts; create wiring files in the user's project so Claude Code can see both canopy internals and project skills
- `skills/canopy-skill/` — renamed from `optimize-skill`; bundled meta-skill for auditing and optimizing Canopy skills

### Changed

- `README.md` — added "How It Works" diagram showing full skill anatomy; added inline examples in Features; added Skill Anatomy section; rewrote Quick Start Option A (vendored via curl/tar, explicit warning against git clone) and Option B (git submodule + setup script); removed manual Submodule Wiring section
- `FRAMEWORK.md` — removed content duplicated in README (intro paragraph, submodule directory tree, Skill Anatomy); added pointer to README for setup instructions
- `rules/skill-resources.md` — updated standalone note to reference setup scripts

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-12

- `rules/skill-resources.md` — ambient rules for standalone use
- `skills/shared/framework/ops.md` — framework primitives: `IF`, `ELSE_IF`, `ELSE`, `BREAK`, `END`, `ASK`, `SHOW_PLAN`, `VERIFY_EXPECTED`
- `skills/shared/project/ops.md` — stub with commented examples for project-wide ops
- `skills/shared/ops.md` — redirect stub
- `skills/canopy-skill/` — bundled meta-skill for auditing and optimizing Canopy skills
